## Project Description

The Tokenized Parking Space Rental project is a blockchain-based solution that revolutionizes urban parking management by tokenizing parking spaces as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This decentralized platform allows parking space owners to list their spaces, set rental prices, and earn passive income, while providing drivers with a transparent, secure, and efficient way to find and rent parking spaces.

Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, the system leverages the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where all transactions are recorded on-chain. Each parking space is represented as an ERC-721 NFT, ensuring unique ownership and enabling seamless transfers of parking space ownership rights.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized, efficient, and transparent parking ecosystem that addresses urban mobility challenges through blockchain technology. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Intermediaries**: Create a direct peer-to-peer marketplace between parking space owners and renters
- **Maximize Space Utilization**: Ensure optimal usage of available parking spaces through dynamic pricing and availability tracking
- **Generate Passive Income**: Enable property owners to monetize their unused parking spaces
- **Reduce Urban Congestion**: Help drivers find parking spaces quickly, reducing time spent searching and traffic congestion
- **Foster Transparency**: Provide complete transparency in pricing, availability, and transaction history through blockchain technology
- **Scale Globally**: Create a universal standard for parking space tokenization that can be adopted worldwide

## Key Features

### Core Smart Contract Functions

1. **createParkingSpace(location, pricePerHour)**
   - Tokenizes a parking space as an ERC-721 NFT
   - Records location, pricing, and ownership information
   - Emits events for tracking and indexing
   - Returns unique space ID for reference

2. **rentParkingSpace(spaceId, durationHours)**
   - Enables users to rent available parking spaces
   - Handles payment processing and validation
   - Creates rental records with timestamps
   - Automatically transfers payment to space owner
   - Supports rentals up to 24 hours duration

3. **completeRental(rentalId)**
   - Marks rental as completed when time expires
   - Makes parking space available for new rentals
   - Can be called by renter or space owner
   - Maintains rental history and analytics

### Additional Features

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Space owners can update hourly rates based on demand
- **Rental History**: Complete transaction history for both spaces and users
- **Availability Tracking**: Real-time status updates for all parking spaces
